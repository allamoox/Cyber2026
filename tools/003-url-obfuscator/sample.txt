Hello world!! I’m usually hanging around irc://wechall.net:6667 and https://cker.space,
and sometimes you’ll see me on http://1091see.com or https://sub.1091see.com
when I forget where I deployed things.

I started out building small stuff on http://hmoud.info before moving parts to
https://blog.cker.space and testing APIs on http://api.hmoud.info or https://dev.hmoud.info.

I don’t really like using hxxps://www[.]facebook[.]com anymore,
but you can still find me on https://www.linkedin.com,
or reading docs on https://github.com and https://api.github.com late at night.

Some days I’m pushing experiments to http://staging.cker.space
or breaking things on http://1091see.com,
while logs quietly mention http://cdn.cloudflare.com,
https://aws.amazon.com, and https://google.com.

If you see this in a ticket, please deobfuscate:
